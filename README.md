# Sentiment Analysis with Bert 

In this project, I explored the classical transformer, Bert Architecture and it's application. Built a Bert based classifier to predict the sentiment of movie reviews using a large dataset (Large Movie Review Dataset v1). Fine-tuned Bert using contrastive learning, extracted embeddings and visualized via TSNE. Built logistic regression models to predict the sentiment labels using tsne components. Moreover, further improved the model by adding a classification layer to the model and output sentiment analysis results directly.

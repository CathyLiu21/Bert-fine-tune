In this project, I explored the classical transformer, Bert Architecture and it's application. Built a Bert based calssfiier to predict the sentitment of movie reviews using a large dataset (Large Movie Review Dataset v1). Fine-tuned Bert using contrastive learning and adjusted the hyperparameters to improve the model performance.
